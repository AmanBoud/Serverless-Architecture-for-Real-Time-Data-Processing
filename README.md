# Serverless-Architecture-for-Real-Time-Data-Processing
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time data processing system using a serverless architecture. It eliminates the need for traditional backend server management by utilizing cloud functions and real-time communication protocols.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time data streaming with WebSockets
- Serverless functions for backend logic (AWS Lambda / Firebase Functions)
- NoSQL database integration (Firestore / DynamoDB)
- REST API fallback for non-real-time clients
- Event-driven architecture using message queues or Pub/Sub
- Lightweight, scalable, and cost-efficient
